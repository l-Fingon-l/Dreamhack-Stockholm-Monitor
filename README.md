# Dreamhack Stockholm Monitor
This tiny tool was created to monitor the location of Dreamhack Stockholm 2021 participants prior to the tournament start.  

It uses the [W3Champions](https://w3champions.com/) API to get the player's *latest login location* which is afterwards used to convert it to that country's flag.  

There is some depth in the search algorithm but in the end all it does is display the flags of the players to mark their current location which could have been useful prior to the tournament as they had been gathering in Stockholm.
